                        <strong>Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease,</strong> is an ancient infectious disease that continues to affect millions of people around the world, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare. This debilitating disease not only causes physical suffering but also carries a social stigma, often leading to isolation and exclusion from society. Leprosy patients not only endure the physical pain caused by the disease but also face the burden of starvation due to economic hardships. Our campaign aims to contribute rations and medical kits to leprosy patients, to lessen their burden from starvation and pain.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Understanding the Challenges Faced by Leprosy Patients:</strong> Leprosy attacks the peripheral nerves, resulting in a loss of sensation in the affected areas, often leading to wounds, infections, and deformities. The disease gradually weakens the immune system, leaving patients susceptible to secondary infections. Many leprosy patients lose their ability to work, which restricts their access to food and livelihood opportunities, exacerbating their already precarious economic situation.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Starvation and its Impact on Leprosy Patients:</strong> The lack of access to nutritious food takes a severe toll on leprosy patients, who require a balanced diet to support their weakened immune systems and promote healing. Malnutrition weakens their bodies, making them more susceptible to infections and worsening their symptoms. Moreover, the pain and discomfort from hunger add to their psychological distress, creating a vicious cycle of suffering.

                <div class="third para">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Relief Through Ration Distribution:</strong> Contributing rations to leprosy patients is a compassionate and practical way to address their immediate needs. Ration kits containing staple foods, fresh fruits, and vegetables can help meet their nutritional requirements, strengthening their immune systems and improving their overall health. Regular access to food can also help alleviate the stress and anxiety related to uncertainty about their next meal, providing a sense of security and stability.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Medical Kits for Pain Relief:</strong> In addition to proper nutrition, medical kits tailored to the specific needs of leprosy patients can significantly reduce their pain and discomfort. These kits should include wound care supplies, pain relievers, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory medications. Proper wound care is essential for preventing infections, while pain management is crucial to improving the quality of life for these individuals.

                            <p>To qualify for tax exemption on your donations, you need to obtain a <strong>10BE</strong>. This can be done by filing your <strong>80G</strong> claims for donations made during the Financial Year (FY). You can download your <strong>10BE</strong> from the ‘My Profile’ section by <strong>31st May</strong> of the next FY and also receive it via email.</p>

                            <p>For example: if you made donations between <strong>April 2023</strong> and <strong>March 2024</strong> (FY 2023-24), you will get your <strong>10BE</strong> by <strong>31st May 2024</strong>, provided you need to claim the <strong>80G</strong> for these donations.</p>

                            <p>Please note that you cannot claim <strong>80G</strong> for donations made between <strong>April 2022</strong> and <strong>March 2023</strong> (FY 2022-23) anymore as the window for claiming it has closed. However, you can still get the <strong>10BEs</strong> for that year if you made <strong>80G</strong> claims on or before <strong>31st July 2023</strong>.</p>
