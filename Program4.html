        Real Happiness of Life Foundation plans to set up Home For Homeless in Bhiwandi to Care to the homeless as well as those suffering from mental health issues in and around Mumbai. Every being deserves a peaceful life, however, this is often not the case. We see some people living on the sidewalk, some under vehicle bridges, some at railway stations, some having amputated parts of the body,
 developing decomposition. In the end, they fall prey to their disease. Those who have an accident on the road are left to die. Such people suffer from excessive hunger and thirst. Even after this, no one bothers to help anyone. Our plan is to provide them with necessary medical care and 
 psychology sessions with experienced doctors to deal with trauma, depression and other mental health issues. We will also cater to those facing mental troubles during old age and those who are facing drug addiction. Our aim is not just to have homes for humans who are left to bleed on roads with no one to provide them with necessary medical care.
<br>


Real Happiness of Life Foundation wishes to create a society that is filled with happy faces and make one so strong that they would be able to handle problems that come their way. We wish no one dies due to mental traumas and depression. We want a society where there is a smile on every face and confidence in every heart. We wish to be a custodian to the homeless and needy, be it humans. We believe that our sessions and care will bring in new life to those who have suffered for years but had no one to share their problems with. We wish to extend our helping hand to those in need. Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter.
<br>


Sometimes they are abandoned due to old age and illness. some people live on the sidewalk Some people live under vehicle bridges, some spend time at railway stations, some have amputated parts of the body, developing decomposition. In the end, they fall prey to their disease. Those who have an accident on the road are left to die. Such people suffer from excessive hunger and thirst. Even after this no one bothers to help anyone.
<br>
Life is extremely difficult for these humans. Unlike us, they voice their pain and needs.
